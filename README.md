# This is a third try to make a board game. Now with react!

##Done:

* map generation
* turn cycle
* game log
* basic movement
* freeze mechanic
* detect new circle on map (to get profit, etc)
* player stats (rounds on map, karma, money earned/spent etc)

##TODO:

* manual acton button (for buy something for example)
* Costa De Banana flag to get favicon, app icons and some style (colors)
* advanced movement
* basic modal window realization (portals)
* tile events
* buy small property
* stock property and stocks mechanics
* stocks UI view
* player status (adventurer, businessman, mafioso and etc)
* init game screen with settings and quick start feature
* lots, lots of UI!

##Future milestones:

* win conditions
* game rules and help
* localization (en, ru)
* images for tiles
* save and load via local storage
* main menu (play, about, rules/help)
* game menu (return, save, load, exit to main menu)
* game board scale and movement (like a camera movement)
* bots for single player
* [maybe] authorization via social networks and multiplayer
